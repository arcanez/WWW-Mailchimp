NAME
    WWW::Mailchimp - Perl wrapper around the Mailchimp v1.3 API

SYNOPSIS
    use strict; use WWW::Mailchimp

    my $mailchimp = WWW::Mailchimp->new(apikey => $apikey); # defaults (
    datacenter => 'us1', timeout => 5, output_format => 'json', api_version
    => 1.3 )

    my $campaigns = $mailchimp->campaigns; my $lists = $mailchimp->lists; my
    $subscribers = $mailchimp->listMembers( $lists->[0]->{id} ); my $ok =
    $mailchimp->listSubscribe( id => $lists->[0]->{id}, email_address =>
    'foo@bar.com', update_existing => 1, merge_vars => [ FNAME => 'foo',
    LNAME => 'bar' ] );

DESCRIPTION
    WWW::Mailchimp is a simple Perl wrapper around the Mailchimp API v1.3.

    It is as simple as creating a new WWW::Mailchimp object and calling
    ->method Each key/value pair becomes part of a query string, for
    example:

      $mailchimp->listSubscribe( id => 1, email_address => 'foo@bar.com' );

    results in the query string:
    ?method=listSubscribe&id=1&email_address=foo@bar.com apikey, output, etc
    are tacked on by default. This is also uri_escaped

BUGS
    Currently, this module is hardcoded to JSON::from_json the result of the
    LWP request. This should be changed to be dependent on the
    output_format. Patches welcome.

    I am also rather sure handling of merge_vars can be done better. If it
    isn't working properly, you can always use a key of 'merge_vars[FNAME]',
    for example.
